# Template-Based Review System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented all 6 requirements for the template-based review system with Celery auto-publishing and SendGrid email integration.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Template-Based Forms (Instead of API)
- **Feedback form from backend itself, no API for that**
- Created Django forms in `reviews/forms.py`
- Template views in `reviews/views.py` (submit_review_template, published_reviews_template)
- HTML templates in `reviews/templates/reviews/`

### 2. Widget Template Display
- **Published feedback visible in page after clicking widget (no API, use templates)**
- Template view: `published_reviews_template()` 
- URL: `/reviews/published/<user_id>/`
- Displays all published reviews with statistics and filtering

### 3. Rating-Based Publishing Logic
- **Positive reviews (rating >= 3) published instantly**
- **Negative reviews (rating < 3) require 7-day response window**
- Implemented in both API and template views
- Auto-publish date set automatically for negative reviews

### 4. Celery Auto-Publishing
- **Auto-publish using django-celery if user doesn't respond within timeframe**
- Task: `schedule_auto_publish_review` - schedules auto-publish for exact date
- Periodic task: `check_pending_reviews_for_auto_publish` - runs hourly as backup
- Reminder system: sends alerts at 3, 5, and 6 days

### 5. SendGrid Email Integration
- **Writing review link sent via email using SendGrid, not django send_mail**
- Complete SendGrid service in `reviews/email_utils.py`
- Professional HTML email templates for all notifications
- Replaces all Django email functionality

### 6. Enhanced Review Request Process
- **Review request emails with proper links to template forms**
- Links point to template views instead of API endpoints
- Better user experience with guided forms

## 🔗 New URLs

| URL Pattern | View Function | Purpose |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| `/reviews/submit/<token>/` | `submit_review_template` | Template-based review form |
| `/reviews/published/<user_id>/` | `published_reviews_template` | Public review display |
| `/reviews/widget/<user_id>/` | `widget_view` | Embed widget (existing) |

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

### 1. SendGrid Setup
```python
# In settings.py or environment variables
SENDGRID_API_KEY = 'your_sendgrid_api_key'
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL = 'noreply@yourdomain.com'
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME = 'Your Business Name'
SITE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.com'
```

### 2. Celery Setup
```python
# Redis required for Celery broker
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
```

### 3. Running Services
```bash
# Start Redis
redis-server

# Start Celery worker
celery -A review_collection_system worker -l info

# Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks)
celery -A review_collection_system beat -l info

# Start Django development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## 📧 Email Flow

### For Positive Reviews (Rating >= 3)
1. Customer submits review via template form
2. Review published immediately
3. SendGrid sends thank you email to customer
4. Business can see published review instantly

### For Negative Reviews (Rating < 3)
1. Customer submits review via template form
2. Review status set to 'pending_moderation'
3. Auto-publish date set to 7 days from submission
4. SendGrid sends alert email to business owner
5. Celery schedules reminder emails (days 3, 5, 6)
6. Celery schedules auto-publish task for day 7
7. If no response by day 7, review auto-publishes
8. SendGrid sends notifications to both customer and business

## 🎯 Review Logic

```python
# Rating-based logic
if rating >= 3:
    status = 'published'
    auto_publish_date = None
    # Send customer thank you email
else:
    status = 'pending_moderation' 
    auto_publish_date = now + 7 days
    # Send business alert email
    # Schedule auto-publish task
    # Schedule reminder emails
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Test overview
python manage.py test_implementation

# Test specific components
python manage.py test_implementation --test-emails
python manage.py test_implementation --test-templates
python manage.py test_implementation --test-celery
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Upload Sales Report (Triggers Review Requests)
```python
# POST /api/reviews/sales-report/upload/
{
    "report_date": "2025-01-20",
    "orders": [
        {
            "order_id": "ORD001",
            "customer_name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john@example.com",
            "phone": "+1234567890"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Customer Receives Email
- Email contains link: `https://yourdomain.com/reviews/submit/{token}/`
- Customer clicks link and sees template form
- Form includes star rating, product field, and review text

### 3. Review Submission
- Positive reviews (>=3 stars): Published immediately
- Negative reviews (<3 stars): 7-day response window
- Business owner gets email notifications
- Automatic reminders and publishing

### 4. Public Review Display
- URL: `https://yourdomain.com/reviews/published/{user_id}/`
- Shows all published reviews with statistics
- Filterable by rating
- Pagination support

## 🔄 Migration Applied

```bash
# New fields added to Review model
python manage.py makemigrations reviews
python manage.py migrate
```

New fields:
- `product_name` - CharField for product/service name
- `auto_published_at` - DateTimeField for auto-publish timestamp
